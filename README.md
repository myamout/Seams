# SEAMS

## About
Simple website created for my friend, who is an up and coming DJ. As of now the website features links to his mixes on SoundCloud, MixCloud, and a means to contact him.

## Technologies Used
I wanted to keep the site simple and easy to deploy. Something this simple that doesn't require a database doesn't necessarily call for an in-depth backend. Therefore I choose to use Google's framework, Polymer 2.0. Having worked with Polymer 1.0 I wanted to experiment and see what Google rewrote. Using the Polymer CLI I was able to test and build the website with a few commands. Full credit to the Google team as some of the site is modeled after their helpful examples
